# Human-Agent Interaction Patterns in Workflow Automation

Human-computer interaction and its resulting workflows have historically been highly human-mediated, meaning a lot of input from humans is required in order for a computer to aid in the completion of a task. Fully automating these workflows would result in significant savings in cost, time, cognitive load for humans. With the advent of LLMs, we face the possibility of a new class of agents that can take instructions in natural language to perform more intelligent functions, including performing actions in the physical and digital world, extrapolating for further natural language instructions in multi-agent settings, and following these instructions in a collaborative manner. These agents could make computing systems more easily blend with human systems, and they could lead to a wide spectrum of new collaborative paradigms, from blended human-computer systems all the way to fully autonomous computing systems.

To be able to fully leverage the power of AI agents, it is important to understand the various patterns of interactions in human-agent workflows in-depth so that we can use them as reference architectures for mapping use cases to specific scenarios. The figure below illustrates the various patterns of interest.

* **Human-Agent Loop**: This pattern could also be called “agent augmentation,” since the human initiates the task and requires the agents to complete it. Such workflows could take input back and forth between the human and the machine world many times until completion. An example of such a workflow could be a chatbot to help open a bank account or one to help buy a ticket from a website. In these examples, the multi-agent processors present could be a planning and orchestration agent, a Web action agent, a document processing agent, an information gathering agent, etc., all of which could collaborate to get the task done for the human request.
* **Human-Agent-Human Loop**: This pattern could also be called an agent-augmented human-human collaboration or communication. This pattern arises when the presence of an agent enhances or makes collaboration between two humans more efficient. An example of such a workflow could be a voice assistant which transcribes a doctor-patient conversation or a meeting assistant which summarizes a discussion between employees.
* **Agent-Human-Agent Loop**: This pattern occurs when the key tasks in a workflow are done by agents, but the agents need some critical human input in order to be able to complete the workflow. “Critical human input” could be things like making a complex plan or crucial decision of which the agents might not be capable. An example of such a workflow could be loan approval, where the loan agent could have collected all relevant information and worked with other agents to arrive at a decision, but it still requires human input to complete the final approval. In this case, there may be aspects material to this decision missed by the agents, such as a larger context in understanding human responsibility and an understanding of alignment with company values.
* **Agent-Agent Loop**: This pattern deals with the workflows where agents can completely autonomously complete all tasks. We do not believe highly critical workflows will be completely autonomous in the near-term, but we believe they will be semi-autonomous with minimal human intervention. However, non-critical workflows, such as the generation of research reports or marketing materials, could soon be completely autonomous with the use of agents such as a market analyst, report planner, and CFO agent working together to pull information from relevant resources using tools such as a SQL reader, control of the web, and an Excel processor.

Agents present a paradigm shift in how humans may interact with computers, and the world at large, in the near future. Most human workflows that include computing systems are complex and may involve more than one of the above patterns. A number of existing systems will undergo re-designs to embed agents into their workflows. Further, entirely new systems and solutions will evolve as the technologies around agents and LLMs advance. Either way, careful system design with the right set of agents and interaction patterns in mind will go a long way in building scalable, maintainable, and accountable human-computer systems.
